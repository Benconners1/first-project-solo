  <p style="width:50%">The GLOCK 19 Gen5 pistol in 9mm Luger is ideal for a more versatile role due to its reduced dimensions. The new frame
  design without finger grooves still allows to instantly customize its grip to accommodate any hand size by mounting the
  different back straps. The reversible magazine catch and ambidextrous slide stop lever make it ideal for left and
  right-handed shooters. The rifling and the crown of the barrel were slightly modified for increased precision.</p>

  <p style="width:50%">The MK18 is a 10.3 inch short barreled AR-15 made by Daniel Defense. It's grown in popularity in large part due to its
  utilization by Special Operators wielding it in the global war on terror. It will do most anything your typical AR-15
  can do but better â€“ with a couple of caveats.</p>

  <p style="width:50%">Remington Model 700 is a series of bolt-action centerfire rifles manufactured by Remington Arms since 1962. It is a
  development of the Remington 721 and 722 series of rifles, which were introduced in 1948. The M24 and M40 military
  sniper rifles, used by the US Army and USMC, respectively, are both based on the Model 700 design.</p>
